====================
What is ScanHub?
====================

**ScanHub** is an open-source, cloud-oriented **multimodal acquisition platform** for medical imaging workflows, with a current focus on **MRI**. It integrates device management, exam planning, sequence management, workflow execution and cloud-based reconstruction/processing into one coherent platform and UI.

Why it exists
=============

Traditional MRI console workflows are costly to scale, hard to extend, and often siloed. ScanHub shifts reconstruction and processing tasks into a cloud-ready, modular architecture, enabling:

- **Scalability & flexibility** – run heavier workloads in the cloud, plug in your own microservices.
- **Open innovation** – avoid vendor lock-in; build on transparent, community-driven components.
- **Collaboration & sharing** – central data handling and standard formats encourage teamwork.
- **Interoperability** – sequence, device and workflow managers target open standards and cross-manufacturer use.

Key building blocks
===================

- **Device Manager** – register/select devices (incl. simulated devices).
- **Exam Manager** – plan acquisitions and review completed results.
- **MRI Sequences Manager** – manage and inspect sequences.
- **Workflow Engine** – orchestrates reconstruction/processing jobs.
- **Web UI (scanhub-ui)** – single entry point for operators and researchers.

Licensing
=========

ScanHub is **dual-licensed**: GPLv3 **or** a commercial license from BRAIN-LINK UG. Choose GPLv3 for open-source use; choose commercial to embed without copyleft obligations and to obtain premium services. (See the “ScanHub” page for details.)
